This app was created for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree course.
The purpose of this app is to present users with the details about most popular, top-rated
and favourite movies. 

## The main tasks for this project were to:

* Fetch data from the remote endpoint
* Present users with a list of most popular, top-rated or their favourite movie titles based on their selection
* Present users with all the details regarding a given movie
* Allow users to add and remove films from their "favourites" that are stored locally
* Include a Youtube app playback of movie trailers.
* Utilize Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel)

## How to use the application?

For the app to function correctly you
need to create a free API key at https://api.themoviedb.org
and paste it into "api_key" variable in the NetworkUtils class.
